# Personal portfolio

The goal of this portfolio was to create a space where i can present my work. It is my very first project and Im proud of what I achieved. As it is my first project I wanted to put it together with pure Javascript no frameworks. I have focused on responsive design. I made the website so PC, tablet and mobile devices can render the page correctly. Also i wanted to use my knowledge of SASS from a taken course.

### What I learned building the project

I learned how to work with SASS and to structure the code to separate files so It is much clear what style is where. I used my knowledge from courses to make accordion and modal. I also learned how to work with svgs and played with a little filling effect.
